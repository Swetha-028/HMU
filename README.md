COMMUNITY HEALTH MONITORING UNIT
-
**Introduction:**

>A Health Monitoring Unit (HMU) is a device to track and monitor various health parameters, providing real-time data and insights to support better health outcomes. HMUs enable early detection of potential health issues, personalized care, and informed decision-making.

**Components Used:**

*	Arduino mega 
*	Arduino Nano 
*	Ultrasonic sensor 
*	SpO2 sensor 
*	Thermal scanner
*	Load cells 
*	Power supply 
*	LCD display


**Operation:**

*	A Health monitoring device typically works by integrating various sensors and technology to continuously measure and record Vittal health parameters. 

*	Health monitoring device are typically power by rechargeable batteries to ensure portability and continuous operation. 

*	Measurement: the user places that device ultrasonic sensor it measures the height of the person and by use of load cell to measure the weight of the person. 

*	Data processing: the sansar collect the data such as heartbeat blood pressure and oxygen saturation. 

*	Display: the LCD displays the seven major parameters that is height, weight, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, body mass index, fat.

**Essential Parameters:**

>>>**Body mass index [BMI]: -**
• BMI is commonly used as a straining tool to characterized individuals into different weight categories (underweight, normal, over and obesity).
• This helps healthcare professional assespotential health risk associated with weight. 

>>>**Heart rate: -**
• Heart rate is a key indicator of cardiovascular fitness and overall heart health. 
• A lower resting heart rate often indicates better cardiovascular efficiency and fitness levels. 

>>>**Temperature: -**
• Body temperature is a key indicator of health.
• Elevated Temperature can s/g fever, infection while abnormally between temperature or other health issues.

**Benefits:**

1. Real time health tracking: you can monitor your vital signs and health parameters continuously providing immediate feedback on your well-being.
2. Early Detection: HMUs can detect health issues early, allowing for timely interventions and better health outcomes.
2. Personalized Care: HMUs can provide personalized health recommendations and treatment plans based on individual health data.
3. Improved Disease Management: HMUs can help manage chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
