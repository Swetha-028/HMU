COMMUNITY HEALTH MONITORING UNIT
The primary purpose of a Health Monitoring Unit (HMU) is to track and monitor various health parameters, providing real-time data and insights to support better health outcomes. HMUs enable early detection of potential health issues, personalized care, and informed decision-making. This empowers patients to take an active role in their healthcare.
